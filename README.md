# Incident Response System using LoRa

## Problem Statement

Global warming driven rise in sea surface temperatures, climatic changes etc. are accentuating disasters
like floods and hurricanes. In addition, during disasters like
earthquake, communication systems such as the cellular
networks, Internet and telephones invariably get affected
including the power supply. Repairing and restoring
communication networks and power supply lines can take
much longer time periods. Post event, instant restoration of
communication network is necessary to provide focused relief
and rescue support. Access to wireless communication
provides direction to the fire fighters, rescue operators and
other emergency service providers the necessary leads in
locating the distressed. The paper introduces a technique that
help to establish a reliable communication system in the
affected area by using a Wi-Fi mesh network and LoRa (Long
Range) WAN with inbuilt battery support for long-distance
communication. The system would support the first responders
in identifying the people with great accuracy using GPS
present in the userâ€™s devices. The developed prototype found to
be working and can be readily used by the relevant authorities.



## Introduction

* During disasters like earthquake, communication systems such as the cellular
networks, Internet and telephones get affected
* Repairing and restoring communication networks can take much longer time periods.
* Instant restoration of communication network is necessary to provide focused relief
and rescue support. 
* In
general, people who are stuck in affected areas will be in
isolation and often not having connectivity to communicate
with first responders. 
* In this project, we are proposing a
system that provide immediate communications network
access post-disaster scenario or similar conditions.

* The device proposed in this paper can be deployed either
physically or through drones into the targeted areas to
provide basic communication support. 
* These devices are
developed to run on lithium-ion battery, that can power the
device for weeks. 
* The devices can be placed in a 3D printed
waterproof case for proper protection of circuits and other
electronic components. 
* All of the connection credentials are
configured at the time of installing the firmware.
* After
deploying, the device, it automatically connects to the main
node to form a mesh network. 
* The range of the device is
nearly unlimited since new devices can extend the range of
communication exponentially. 
* Accordingly, the project
proposes a technique that helps to establish a reliable
communication system in the affected area by using a Wi-Fi
mesh network and LoRa (Long Range) WAN for longdistance communication.

## Advantages of the device is as follows:

* Since the data is sent through the mesh network, additional sensors can be attached to gather more information 
* A temperature sensor can be added to the nodes to get temperature and can be used to detect wildfires in advance
* Air quality sensor can be attached to measure air quality in chemical industries or large production facility 
* These modules can be configured to get lots of information from various different industries.
