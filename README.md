# Incident Response System using LoRa

## Problem Statement

Global warming driven rise in sea surface
temperatures, climatic changes etc. are accentuating disasters
like floods and hurricanes. In addition, during disasters like
earthquake, communication systems such as the cellular
networks, Internet and telephones invariably get affected
including the power supply. Repairing and restoring
communication networks and power supply lines can take
much longer time periods. Post event, instant restoration of
communication network is necessary to provide focused relief
and rescue support. Access to wireless communication
provides direction to the fire fighters, rescue operators and
other emergency service providers the necessary leads in
locating the distressed. The paper introduces a technique that
help to establish a reliable communication system in the
affected area by using a Wi-Fi mesh network and LoRa (Long
Range) WAN with inbuilt battery support for long-distance
communication. The system would support the first responders
in identifying the people with great accuracy using GPS
present in the userâ€™s devices. The developed prototype found to
be working and can be readily used by the relevant authorities.



## Introduction
  Natural disasters kill on an average 60,000 people
annually (independent sources). If one looks into the trends
in the disaster related casualities, the number of natural
calamities related deaths has drastically reduced over a
period of time, thanks to various weather forecasting
methods. Nonetheless, obviously on account of climate
change and increasing surface sea temperature and other
factors, the frequency of natural disaster may not reduce.
There were more than 8,000 disasters between 1990 and
2014 in a sample of 228 nations and regions. Natural
catastrophes are an important risk to small, lower-income
nations as such eventualities can instantly wipe out a notable
portion of their GDP. International agencies like IMF
viewed that, most types of weather-related accidents will
become more prevalent by the end of the century. The
recurrence of disasters caused by heat waves, tropical storms
and wildfires will rise considerably. While experts presume
that the overall repetition of tropical storms will decrease in a
warmer world, they also suspect the storms that appear to be
more intense; which will probably result in more natural
disasters. As natural catastrophes become more prevalent and
powerful, the world must be prepared to address this change.
Furthermore, our examination implies that increased risk
from natural catastrophes will manifest itself on top of the
longer-term adverse effects that temperature gains have on
macroeconomic activity. There must be enhanced use of
technology to prepare the relief providing agencies.

  There are multiple ways to address the natural fury.
Countries can advance in resilient infrastructure that endure
increasing sea levels and higher wind velocities; better early
warning systems are necessary to decrease future costs.
Once the disaster struck, the immediate approach must be to
ensure that reliefs and rescue supports are reaching to the
affected area instantly so that loss life is minimised. In
general, people who are stuck in affected areas will be in
isolation and often not having connectivity to communicate
with first responders. In this paper, we are proposing a
system that provide immediate communications network
access post-disaster scenario or similar conditions.

  The device proposed in this paper can be deployed either
physically or through drones into the targeted areas to
provide basic communication support. These devices are
developed to run on lithium-ion battery, that can power the
device for weeks. The devices can be placed in a 3D printed
waterproof case for proper protection of circuits and other
electronic components. In addition, keeping in view the
emergencies, in order to quickly ensure communication, the
device does not require any configuration after releasing it to
the disaster-prone areas. All of the connection credentials are
configured at the time of installing the firmware. After
deploying, the device, it automatically connects to the main
node to form a mesh network. The range of the device is
nearly unlimited since new devices can extend the range of
communication exponentially. Accordingly, the paper
proposes a technique that helps to establish a reliable
communication system in the affected area by using a Wi-Fi
mesh network and LoRa (Long Range) WAN for longdistance communication.
